        <h1>INTRODUCTION:</h1>
        <p>In an effort to enhance road safety and provide timely assistance in the event of accidents, the Accident Alert System has been developed. Targeted primarily for 4-wheelers, this technology incorporates sophisticated sensors and communication modules to detect accidents and promptly notify emergency contacts and the driver's family members. By leveraging components such as Arduino Uno, accelerometer, GPS module, and GSM SIM7600, this system aims to mitigate the impact of accidents by ensuring swift response and assistance.</p>        
        <h1>WORKING:</h1>
        <p>The Accident Alert System is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance road safety by swiftly detecting and responding to accidents in 4-wheelers. At its core, the system utilizes an accelerometer to monitor changes in vehicle acceleration, a key indicator of potential accidents. When a sudden and abnormal acceleration pattern is detected, signaling a possible collision or impact, the Arduino Uno microcontroller interprets this data as an accident occurrence. Simultaneously, the GPS module integrated into the system provides real-time location information of the vehicle, crucial for accurately pinpointing the accident site. This combination of accelerometer and GPS technology forms the foundation for the system's accident detection capability, ensuring timely and accurate identification of accidents.
        <p>            Upon confirmation of an accident, the Arduino Uno triggers the GSM module SIM7600 to generate an alert. This alert includes vital information such as the vehicle's current location obtained from the GPS module. SMS alerts are then sent to predefined emergency contacts, including emergency services and the driver's family members, informing them of the accident and providing them with the necessary details to initiate immediate assistance. Continuous monitoring is facilitated through looped programming, maintaining constant vigilance over vehicle acceleration and minimizing the risk of missed alerts. Furthermore, a feedback mechanism is incorporated to ensure the reliability of the system, with confirmation of receipt of the alert message triggering appropriate follow-up actions. Remote access capabilities allow users to query the system status and receive real-time updates on accident incidents, empowering emergency responders to coordinate rescue efforts effectively. Ultimately, the Accident Alert System aims to improve road safety by enabling swift and coordinated responses to accidents, potentially saving lives and reducing the severity of injuries.</p>
