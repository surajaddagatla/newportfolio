        <h1>INTRODUCTION:</h1>
        <p>Lossless image compression is a vital technique employed in various applications to reduce storage space requirements while preserving the original quality and clarity of images. This MATLAB-based system aims to achieve precisely that by implementing a compression algorithm that ensures no loss of information during the compression process. By leveraging techniques such as grayscale conversion, image resizing, and discrete cosine transform (DCT), this system compresses images efficiently while maintaining their visual fidelity. Additionally, the system incorporates metrics such as peak-signal-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean-square error (MSE) to quantitatively evaluate the compression quality, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of the compression process.</p>
        <h1>WORKING:</h1>
        <p>The lossless image compression system in MATLAB operates through a series of meticulously designed steps to preserve image quality while reducing storage space requirements. Beginning with the loading of the input image, the system proceeds to convert it to grayscale, simplifying subsequent processing while retaining essential image features. Following grayscale conversion, the image may undergo resizing to lower resolution, optimizing the compression process without sacrificing visual fidelity. This step helps manage computational complexity and memory usage effectively. Subsequently, the resized image is subjected to the discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithm, which transforms the spatial domain image into the frequency domain. By representing the image in terms of its frequency components, redundant information is minimized, facilitating efficient compression while ensuring preservation of image quality. The transformed image data, containing compressed frequency components, is then saved into a compressed image file format such as JPEG for storage or transmission.
<p>            Upon compression, the system quantitatively evaluates the quality of the compressed image using metrics such as peak-signal-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean-square error (MSE). PSNR provides a measure of the quality of the compressed image compared to the original, while MSE quantifies the average squared difference between pixel values, reflecting the compression-induced distortion. Additionally, the compressed image is visually compared to the original to assess the preservation of image clarity and quality. By following this systematic approach, the MATLAB-based lossless image compression system ensures that the compressed images maintain their original quality and fidelity, making it suitable for various applications where image preservation is paramount. Through quantitative evaluation and visual comparison, the system empowers users to make informed decisions regarding image storage, transmission, and usage, thereby enhancing efficiency and reliability in image processing tasks.</p>
